# PhonePe Transaction Insights

**PhonePe Transaction Insights** is a data analytics and visualization project that explores India’s digital payment landscape using PhonePe’s publicly available transaction data. The goal is to uncover transaction trends, user behavior, regional patterns, and business opportunities using advanced SQL queries, Python analysis, interactive dashboards (Streamlit), and compelling visualizations (Power BI).
